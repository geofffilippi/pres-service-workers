Bad coverage. Dead zones. Tunnels. Airplanes. Wilderness. Rural areas. Urban canyons. Slow connections. Congested connections.

Offline happens. Mobile users are at the mercy of wireless carriers to improve the network. When users are offline, there is something web developers can do to help. Progressive web apps can be downloaded for offline use. Network connectivity can be managed.

Native mobile applications are expected to be usable offline. Mobile-first web applications can benefit from the same capability.

Service Workers are a new feature in the web browser. Service Workers enable offline applications. Service Workers are replacing the deprecated Application Cache. Service Workers are ready to use on Android device browsers. However, on Apple iOS devices, we are stuck using App Cache, for now.

In this talk, Geoff Filippi, will cover the current and upcoming options for offline applications. We will review the options for developing cross-platform offline web applications. We will compare the capabilities of mobile web browsers and native applications.
